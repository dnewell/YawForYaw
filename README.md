# YawForYaw
__Live rotation options for YawCam streams.__  Adds _Image Yaw_&trade; to YawCam where it was needed most. Very sexy. Love it or your money back.

__Less absurdly said:__ this repo contains drop-in replacement templates adding a 'Rotation' menu to YawCam's streaming interface.
Both MJPEG and Javascript stream templates have been modded.
All other functionality has been maintained, and a few small bugs have been fixed!

## Installation:

So very easy. Do this:
1. Replace the two YawCam `\stream\` template pages with the lovingly modded versions contained in this repository.
(On Windows 10, these templates are located at: ```C:\Users\_yourAwesomeUsername_\.yawcam\stream\```)
2. `Shift-F5` / refresh any open streams
3. Enter a new and sexy world filled with rotation options. Ahhhhh.

___Completely broken on IE. Thankfully, the fix is obvious and simple - get a better browser. Be happier. Fitter. More productive.___

_Seriously, though: if anyone cares, pull requests are welcome._
