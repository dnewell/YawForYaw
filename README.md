__Live rotation options for YawCam streams.__  Adds _Image Yaw_&trade; to YawCam where it was needed most. Very sexy. Love it or your money back.

__Less absurdly said:__ this repo contains drop-in replacement templates which add a 'Rotation' menu to the streaming interface served by YawCam.
Both Javascript and MJPEG stream formats template mods are included.
All other YawCam functionality has been maintained, and a few small bugs have been fixed.

## Installation:

So very easy. Do this:
1. Replace the two YawCam `/stream/` template pages with the lovingly modded versions in this repository.
(On Windows 10, these templates are located at: ```C:\Users\_yourAwesomeUsername_\.yawcam\stream\```)
2. `Shift-F5` / refresh any open streams
3. Enter a new and sexy world filled with rotation options. Ahhhhh.

### Tested and Working on:

___Completely broken on Internet Explorer. Thankfully, the fix is obvious and simple - get a better browser.___

_Seriously, though: if anyone cares, pull requests are welcome._
